Treehouse Tech Degree - Project 01 - Soccer Coordinator
This is my first Team Treehouse iOS Tech Degree project, the Soccer League Coordinator.
I opted to generate my own player score that places emphasis on experience, then height.
For example, I player with experience gets 100 added to their height, while a player 
without experience is just their height.  This technique allowed me to really balance
the teams evenly.
